# Shuffled List Add-on

## Overview

This add-on allows you to add unordered lists which display the list items in a random order every time you review the card. It is similar to the [Insert Randomized Lists (multiple choice)](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1280092568) but does not require a custom note type. The shuffled lists will only work on the front side of the card.

## How to Use it

Highlight the section you want to turn into a shuffled list. Press the dedicated button at the top edit bar (looks like a reload button). The list items will be created based on the newlines in the highlighted text. When reviewing the card, the shuffled list will have circles as bullet points instead of the default list item style. This way you can differentiate shuffled lists from standard unordered lists.

Alternatively you can use the shortcut `ctrl+shift+u` to turn the selected text into a shuffled list.

If you have the [Mini Format Pack](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/295889520) add-on you can undo the shuffled list by highlighting the text and pressing the unordered list button. 

## Installation

You can install the add-on using this link: [Shuffled List](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1261140161)

## Limitations
**Warning**: Use this at your own risk. I have not tested this add-on thoroughly, so there might be some bugs.

Creating nested shuffled lists is not possible. 

To avoid naming conflicts you should not use the id `_shuffle-list-` inside the stylesheet of your card.
